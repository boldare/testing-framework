Design of JS testing framework above Selenium Webdriver.

Main goals:

  - Easy to use, high-level methods
  - All needed waits build-in
  - BDD Layer (Gherkin)
  - Reports useful from both business and developers point of view (Gherkin scenarios, Screenshots, Driver logs, Proxy logs)
  - Headless execution
  - Parallel execution (in the future)
  - Multiple driver configs and devices support (in the future)
